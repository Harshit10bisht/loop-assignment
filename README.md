1. **Cart Management**: Allows users to add items to their shopping carts and view cart contents.
2. **Order Placement**: Enables users to place orders for items in their carts, with support for payment details.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Uses a service-based architecture to separate the business logic from the data access logic.

The project is designed to work with **MongoDB** as its database and includes routes, controllers, and services for handling various operations related to cart and order management.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used to store user carts and orders.
- **Mongoose**: Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For user authentication and authorization.
- **dotenv**: For environment variable management.
- **ES6+**: Modern JavaScript syntax.
